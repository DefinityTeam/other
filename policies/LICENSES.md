# About the License List
Definity has a strict set of allowed licenses.

Respecting humanity doesn't just mean that *we* are transparent; it also means we need to make sure others are too.

This does not limit what we'll fork or contribute to. This only limits what licenses can be used for *original* projects under Definity's name.
