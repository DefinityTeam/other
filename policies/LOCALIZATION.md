## Supported Languages
Localization is a large part of keeping products supported for as many people as possible. However, a lot of people cannot speak every language. Our policy for supporting a language is simple: **if an employee/volunteer at Definity cannot provide support for the product in that language, the language will not be supported.**

While we appreciate that supporting products in many languages will allow for better usage, we simply cannot support translations for a language that we cannot provide support in. Translations aren't always accurate or reliable, so we wouldn't be able to help the people who exclusively speak it.
