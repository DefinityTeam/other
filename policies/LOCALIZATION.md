# Localization policy
Localization is a large part of keeping products supported for as many people as possible. However, a lot of people cannot speak every language. Our policy is simple: **if an employee/volunteer at Definity cannot provide support for the product in that language, the language simply won't be supported.**

Here is the current list of languages supported:
| code | name |
|---|---|
| `en-US` | English (United States) |
| `en-GB` | English (United Kingdom) |
| `hu` | Hungarian |
| `cnm` | Mandarin (Simplified Chinese) |

While we appreciate that having products in many languages will allow for better usage, we simply cannot add translations for a language that we cannot provide support in, as we wouldn't be able to help those people.
