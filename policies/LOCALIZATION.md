# Localization policy
Localization is a large part of keeping products supported for as many people as possible. However, a lot of people cannot speak every language. Our policy is simple: **if an employee/volunteer at Definity cannot provide support for the product in that language, the language simply won't be supported.**

Here is the current list of languages supported:
| code | name | team member(s) |
|---|---|---|
| `en-US` | English (United States) | Not applicable |
| `en-GB` | English (United Kingdom) | Not applicable |
| `hu` | Hungarian | [1s3k3b](https://github.com/1s3k3b) |
| `cnm` | Mandarin (Simplified Chinese) | [kai-01](https://github.com/kai-01) |

While we appreciate that having products in many languages will allow for better usage, we simply cannot add translations for a language that we cannot provide support in, as we wouldn't be able to help those people.
